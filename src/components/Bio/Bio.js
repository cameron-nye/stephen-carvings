        From as early as 4 years I remember having a fascination with God’s 
        creations and a love of the great outdoors. My first passion was 
        geology and rock collecting. Later my interests turned to weather, 
        wildlife, art, and over the past 40 years, birding. From an early age 
        I also enjoyed creating and making things with my hands which 
        eventually led me to a career in building high-end furniture and 
        architectural woodwork.

        Though I did study sculpture while earning a
        degree in Range Management at BYU, as a woodcarver I am primarily 
        self-taught. My art is driven by the feelings, impressions and 
        memories of a life spent out of doors on planet earth in wondrous awe 
        of our avian companions. 
        <br/>
        I have received numerous awards over the 
        years including Best of Show, the Audubon Society Choice Award, the 
        People’s Choice Award, the Wheeler Historic Farm Choice Award, and 
        numerous Best of Division Awards. I also have a piece in the 
        collection of Richard and Heidi Shelley. 
        <br/>
        I’m grateful to my Heavenly Father who has given me a talent to express the special moments and 
        feelings I experience in nature through carving. I am also thankful 
        for the joy and relaxation it brings to my life.
